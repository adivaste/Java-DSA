<hr><hr><p>It seems like you want to write a SQL query to retrieve the IDs of companies that have more employees than a specified number. However, you didn't provide the specific number of employees to compare against. Let's assume you want to find companies with more than 100 employees as an example. You can adjust the number as needed.</p>

<p>Here's a SQL query in standard SQL to achieve this:</p>

<p><code>sql
SELECT ID
FROM COMPANY
WHERE Number_of_Employees &gt; 100;
</code></p>

<p>In this query:
- <code>COMPANY</code> is the name of the table where the company data is stored.
- <code>Number_of_Employees</code> is the column in the <code>COMPANY</code> table that represents the number of employees at each company.
- We use the <code>SELECT</code> statement to retrieve the <code>ID</code> of companies that meet the condition specified in the <code>WHERE</code> clause, which is having more than 100 employees.</p>

<p>Please replace <code>100</code> with the desired number of employees you want to use as the threshold.</p>
<hr><hr><p>It seems like you want to retrieve the IDs of companies that have more employees than a certain threshold, but you haven't provided the specific threshold or criteria for counting the employees. </p>

<p>To provide you with a SQL query in Java (assuming you are using JDBC), I'll assume you want to find companies with more than a specified number of employees. In this case, let's assume you want to find companies with more than 100 employees. You can modify the query accordingly:</p>

<p>```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;</p>

<p>public class EmployeeCountQuery {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://your<em>database</em>url";
        String username = "your<em>username";
        String password = "your</em>password";</p>

<pre><code>    try {
        Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
        String sql = "SELECT ID FROM COMPANY WHERE EmployeeCount &gt; ?";
        int employeeThreshold = 100;

        PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
        preparedStatement.setInt(1, employeeThreshold);

        ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();

        while (resultSet.next()) {
            int companyId = resultSet.getInt("ID");
            System.out.println("Company ID: " + companyId);
        }

        resultSet.close();
        preparedStatement.close();
        connection.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This Java code assumes you have a MySQL database with a "COMPANY" table that has a column named "EmployeeCount" representing the number of employees in each company. Adjust the database connection details, SQL query, and employee threshold as per your specific requirements.</p>

<hr><hr><p>To determine if there is a valid partition for the given array <code>nums</code>, you can follow this Java code:</p>

<p>```java
public boolean hasValidPartition(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    int curr = nums[i];

    // Check for exactly 2 equal elements
    if (i + 1 &lt; n &amp;&amp; nums[i + 1] == curr) {
        i++;
        continue;
    }

    // Check for exactly 3 equal elements
    if (i + 2 &lt; n &amp;&amp; nums[i + 1] == curr &amp;&amp; nums[i + 2] == curr) {
        i += 2;
        continue;
    }

    // Check for exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements
    if (i + 2 &lt; n &amp;&amp; nums[i + 1] == curr + 1 &amp;&amp; nums[i + 2] == curr + 2) {
        i += 2;
        continue;
    }

    return false; // If none of the conditions are met, it's not a valid partition
}

return true; // If all conditions are satisfied, it's a valid partition
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>You can call this function with your input array <code>nums</code> to check if it has at least one valid partition. For example:</p>

<p>```java
int[] nums1 = {4, 4, 4, 5, 6};
boolean result1 = hasValidPartition(nums1); // Should return true</p>

<p>int[] nums2 = {1, 1, 1, 2};
boolean result2 = hasValidPartition(nums2); // Should return false
```</p>

<p>This code will iterate through the array and check each condition mentioned in the problem statement to determine if there is a valid partition.</p>

<hr><hr><p>To find the sum of money at simple interest, you can use the formula:</p>

<p>[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot T}{100} ]</p>

<p>Where:
- (P) is the principal amount (the initial sum of money)
- (R) is the rate of interest per year
- (T) is the time in years</p>

<p>Given that the amount is Rs. 815 in 3 years and Rs. 854 in 4 years, you can set up two equations:</p>

<ol>
<li>(815 = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 3}{100})</li>
<li>(854 = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot 4}{100})</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let's solve this system of equations. First, divide the second equation by the first equation:</p>

<p>(\frac{854}{815} = \frac{\frac{P \cdot R \cdot 4}{100}}{\frac{P \cdot R \cdot 3}{100}})</p>

<p>Simplify:</p>

<p>(\frac{854}{815} = \frac{4}{3})</p>

<p>Now, cross-multiply:</p>

<p>(854 \cdot 3 = 815 \cdot 4)</p>

<p>Solve for (P):</p>

<p>(P = \frac{854 \cdot 3}{4} = 640.5)</p>

<p>So, the principal amount (the sum of money) is approximately Rs. 640.5. Rounding it to the nearest whole number, the sum is Rs. 641. Therefore, none of the provided answer options is correct.</p>

<hr><hr><p>To find the possible number of triangles with the given conditions, we can start by considering the equation for the sum of the sides of a triangle:</p>

<p>a + b + c = 21</p>

<p>Given that a = b Ã¢â€°Â  c, we can rewrite the equation as:</p>

<p>2a + c = 21</p>

<p>Now, let's analyze the possible values of 'a' and 'c' as integers that satisfy this equation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If 'a' is even, then 'c' must be odd, because an even number plus an odd number equals an odd number. The possible values of 'a' and 'c' in this case are:</p>

<p>a = 2, c = 19
a = 4, c = 17
a = 6, c = 15
a = 8, c = 13
a = 10, c = 11</p></li>
<li><p>If 'a' is odd, then 'c' must be even, because an odd number plus an even number equals an odd number. However, in this case, since a=b, 'a' and 'b' cannot be both odd because their sum will be even. So, there are no solutions in this case.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we need to count the combinations where 'a' and 'c' are integers and satisfy the conditions. From the above list, we can see that there are 5 such combinations. Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>

<p><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>So, none of the provided options (12, 10, 4, 8) are correct, and the correct answer is 5.</p>
